problems and suggestions in design:

1. The finger mechanism needs improvement and enhancement; the length of the links may need to be rechecked, and a new trail for the mechanism will give good results.
2. The thumb-finger mechanism needs enhancement and strengthening.
3. The Palm (motors and fingers holder) needs improvements to ensure that it will accommodate the loads and not affect the motion of the fingers.
4. The bevel gear and actuation link must be made from metal or high-strength material; the easiest way is metal 3D printing.
5. Try to manufacture the parts in a high-strength material, not PLA (3D printing).
6. Be sure that the mechanism is well prepared before implementation.
7. Implement the mechanism in the right way to be sure that the mechanism will achieve the expected motion. Many links may be implemented in a reversed way, which will work but affect the limit of motion.
Note: I think the limitation of the motion of the fingers came from the reversed implementation of some parts.

8. For the forearm, the PLA 3D printing with 100% infill will be efficient, but it will be affected by the heat, and at high levels of the forecast temperature, it will melt.
9. The dimensions between fingers need to be edited.
I wish you best wishes and good results on the project. :)
